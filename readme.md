# Ludum Dare 40: WizCorp

## Story
Congratulations on opening your very own WizCorp franchise, $VALUED_INVESTOR_NAME!

You're on your way to supplementing your income by leveraging WizCorp's patented, paradigm-shifting supply-chain management process for producing magically-charged aetheric artifacts--the essential tool for almost every sorcerous industry in today's fast-paced fantasy world.

MINE the aetherium ore from the ground, PROCESS it into aetherium crystal, CRAFT it into aetheric devices, and SELL them for a tidy profit.

Of course, you can't do it alone. For a nominal fee, WizCorp can help you HIRE and seamlessly integrate human resources into your business process.

CAUTION: Thoroughly peer-reviewed and replicated scientific studies suggest that without proper STORAGE, amassing large quantities of aetherium may cause significant time dilation effects. WizCorp challenges the veracity of these controversial claims.

## Concept
WizCorp is an "idle clicker" game where you are producing and converting resources to score points, which can then be spent on upgrades.

If you let resources build up past a certain point, however, your "auto-clickers" will process less often. Note that upgrades later in the chain are less efficient than upgrades earlier in the chain.
